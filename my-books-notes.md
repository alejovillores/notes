## Clean Code

### Meaningful Names

**It should tell you why it exists, what it does, and how it is used**. If a name requires a comment, then the name does not reveal its intent.

1. Avoid Disinformation --> avoid leaving false clues that obscure the meaning of code.\
   Do not refer to a grouping of accounts as an accountList unless it’s actually a List.\
   _"Spelling similar concepts similarly is information. Using inconsistent spellings is dis-
   information."_\
   If names must be different, then they should also mean something different.

2. Use Pronounceable Names --> If you can’t pronounce it, you can’t discuss it without sounding like an idiot.

3. Use Searchable Names --> _"The length of a name should correspond to the size of its scope"_

Interfaces and Implementations --> Don't use IInterface, just Interface

4. Avoid Mental Mapping --> clarity is king.

5. **Classes** and objects should have noun or noun phrase names. Not verbs

6. **Methods** should have verb or verb phrase names
